## 🔧 Required Helper Entities

Before creating the automation, you need to create three input helper entities. These allow you to control the aquarium settings from your dashboard.

Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → [**Helpers**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers/)

### 1. Input Datetime - Daily Start Time

Create a **Date and/or time** helper:
- **Name:** Aquarium Start Time (or your preference)
- **Has date:** ❌ Disabled
- **Has time:** ✅ Enabled
- **Example entity ID:** `input_datetime.aquarium_start_time`

### 2. Input Number - Total Light Duration

Create a **Number** helper:
- **Name:** Aquarium Light Duration (or your preference)
- **Minimum:** 4
- **Maximum:** 12
- **Step size:** 0.5
- **Unit of measurement:** hours
- **Example entity ID:** `input_number.aquarium_light_duration`

### 3. Input Number - Max Brightness

Create a **Number** helper:
- **Name:** Aquarium Max Brightness (or your preference)
- **Minimum:** 1
- **Maximum:** 100
- **Step size:** 1
- **Unit of measurement:** %
- **Example entity ID:** `input_number.aquarium_max_brightness`

💡 **Tip:** Set initial values (e.g., start time: 08:00, duration: 9 hours, brightness: 60%) before creating the automation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Create the three required helper entities** (see above section)
2. **Create an automation** from the blueprint
3. **Select your helper entities:**
   - Daily start time entity (input_datetime you created)
   - Total light duration entity (input_number in hours)
   - Max brightness entity (input_number in %)
4. **Configure your aquarium light entities** (required)
5. **Configure durations:**
   - Transition duration (sunrise/sunset simulation, default: 30 minutes)
6. **(Optional)** Adjust min brightness (default: 1)
7. **(Optional)** Configure maintenance mode toggle (input_boolean, switch, or binary_sensor)
8. **(Optional)** Configure CO2 switch and time offset

The blueprint organizes all settings into collapsible sections for easy configuration.

## 🧠 How It Works

The blueprint creates a natural lighting cycle for your aquarium:

1. **CO2 turns on** at configured offset (default: 60 min before light start)
2. **Lights turn on** to minimum brightness, then **fade in** gradually to maximum brightness over transition duration
3. **Lights stay at max** brightness (total duration minus fade-in and fade-out)
4. **Lights fade out** gradually from maximum to minimum brightness over transition duration, then **turn off**
5. **CO2 turns off** at same offset before light ends
6. **Repeats every day** at the configured start time

**Transition Behavior:**
- At cycle start: Lights instantly turn on to minimum brightness, then smoothly fade to maximum
- During cycle: Smooth brightness changes every minute with gentle 5-second transitions
- At cycle end: Lights smoothly fade to minimum brightness, then instantly turn off
- This creates natural sunrise/sunset simulation while ensuring lights are completely off when not in use

**Maintenance Mode:**
- When toggled on, overrides schedule and sets lights to full brightness
- CO2 automatically turns off for safety during maintenance
- Resume normal schedule by toggling maintenance mode off

**CO2 Timing:**
- CO2 offset is negative (e.g., -60 minutes means CO2 starts 60 min BEFORE lights)
- Allows CO2 to build up in the water before photosynthesis begins
- CO2 also turns off early (same offset before lights end)
- Recommended: -60 minutes for planted tanks

## 🎛️ Configuration Tips

- **Start Time (Dashboard):** Adjust your input_datetime helper to change when lights start. Perfect for seasonal adjustments!
- **Total Light Duration (Dashboard):** Set your input_number between 4-12 hours. Typical planted tanks: 8-10 hours. Easily experiment to find your sweet spot!
- **Max Brightness (Dashboard):** Control with your input_number (1-100%). Start at 60-80% and adjust based on plant growth and algae. Lower = less algae.
- **Transition Duration (Blueprint):** 30-45 min works well for most tanks. Longer transitions (60 min) create ultra-gradual sunrise/sunset.
- **Light Transition (Blueprint):** 5 seconds default provides gentle brightness changes. Set to 0 if your lights don't support transitions.
- **Min Brightness (Blueprint):** Brightness level for sunrise start and sunset end (1-20%). Lights fade between this minimum and your maximum brightness. Keep at 1-5% for dramatic sunrise/sunset effect.
- **CO2 Offset (Blueprint):** -60 minutes default works well for most planted tanks.

## 📊 Example Daily Cycle

With example settings from your dashboard helpers:
- Start time: 08:00 (from input_datetime)
- Total duration: 9 hours (from input_number)
- Max brightness: 60% (from input_number)
- Transition: 30 min (from blueprint)
- CO2 offset: -60 min (from blueprint)

**Daily Timeline:**
- **07:00** - CO2 turns on
- **08:00** - Lights turn on to minimum brightness and begin fading in (sunrise)
- **08:30** - Lights reach max brightness (60%)
- **16:00** - CO2 turns off
- **16:30** - Lights begin fading out (sunset)
- **17:00** - Lights turn off (cycle complete)

💡 **Change anytime from your dashboard!** Adjust start time, duration, or brightness without editing the automation.

## 🔧 Maintenance Mode Helper (Optional)

For convenience, create an input_boolean helper for maintenance mode:

**1. Create Helper**

Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → [**Helpers**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers/)

Create a **Toggle** helper:
- Name: "Aquarium Maintenance Mode"
- Icon: mdi:wrench

**2. Configure in Blueprint**

Select your input_boolean in the **Maintenance Mode Toggle** field.

**Usage:** Toggle ON for feeding/cleaning (full brightness, CO2 off), toggle OFF to resume schedule.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Update Frequency:** Every 60 seconds for smooth, reliable transitions
- **Recovery:** Automatically recovers correct state after HA restart or device reconnection
- **Zigbee Reliability:** 60-second updates prevent command flooding that can cause Zigbee issues
- **Phase Calculation:** Recalculates current phase and brightness on every update for accuracy
- **Availability Handling:** Skips unavailable devices and automatically syncs when they come back online
